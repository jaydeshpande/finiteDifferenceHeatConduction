# finiteDifferenceHeatConduction
Flexible finite difference transient heat conduction solver for solids

The solver provides finite difference solution to 2D conduction in solids. 

Boundary conditions include:
Constant Temperature
Convection 
Mixed (Convection + Radiation) 

Usage:
1. Create Heat_Equation object with grid spacing and thermal diffusivity
2. Set boundary conditions on all 4 faces 
3. run the solver for n timesteps
